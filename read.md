This Terraform configuration sets up an Internet Gateway and a Route Table in AWS, then associates the Route Table with two subnets. Letâ€™s break it down step by step.

1. Creating an Internet Gateway
hcl
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "gateway" { 
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc1.id
}
aws_internet_gateway: This creates an Internet Gateway, which allows resources (like EC2 instances) in the VPC to communicate with the internet.
vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc1.id: This attaches the Internet Gateway to a specific VPC (vpc1).
2. Creating a Route Table
hcl
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_route_table" "routetable" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc1.id
  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.gateway.id
  }
}
aws_route_table: This creates a route table for the VPC (vpc1).
route block:
cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0": This means that the route applies to all outbound traffic (i.e., all destinations).
gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.gateway.id: This routes all outbound traffic through the Internet Gateway.
Purpose:
This route table ensures that any resource (like EC2 instances) using this route table will be able to access the internet.

3. Associating the Route Table with Subnets
hcl
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_route_table_association" "routetableassoc1" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.subnet1.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.routetable.id
}
hcl
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_route_table_association" "routetableassoc2" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.subnet2.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.routetable.id
}
aws_route_table_association: This associates a subnet with the route table.
subnet_id = aws_subnet.subnet1.id: This links subnet1 to the route table.
route_table_id = aws_route_table.routetable.id: This ensures that subnet1 follows the routing rules of routetable.
Purpose:

Since the route table directs traffic to the Internet Gateway, any instance inside subnet1 and subnet2 will now have internet access.
Summary
Creates an Internet Gateway (aws_internet_gateway).
Creates a Route Table (aws_route_table) that sends all outbound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the Internet Gateway.
Associates two subnets (subnet1 and subnet2) with this Route Table, allowing them to access the internet.
ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaway:

This is how you set up a public subnet in AWS.
If you want an EC2 instance in subnet1 or subnet2 to access the internet, you must also:
Assign a public IP or Elastic IP.
Ensure the Security Group and Network ACLs allow outbound internet access.
